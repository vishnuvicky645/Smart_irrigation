# Smart_irrigation
This project uses machine learning to automate irrigation based on sensor data. A Random Forest model is trained to make decisions using environmental features, improving water efficiency and crop management.

🔧 Features
Soil and environmental data analysis

Multi-output irrigation prediction model

Data visualization for monitoring

Model saved for future use with joblib

🛠 Tech Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Google Colab

📁 How to Run
Upload the dataset in Google Colab.

Run the notebook cells step by step.

The model will train and generate predictions.

Save the model using joblib for deployment.
